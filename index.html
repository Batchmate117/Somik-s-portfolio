    <h3>Web Developer,Creative writter and Computer Science and Engineering Student at North South University</h3>
    <p>My name is Somik, and I am currently a 2nd-semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at North South University. My passion for technology and mathematics has driven me to pursue a career in CSE. I enjoy cooking and watching movies in my free time, and these hobbies have helped me develop valuable life skills and a balanced lifestyle. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled and successful CSE engineer and positively impact the industry. I am eager to continue my education and gain practical experience in the field, and I have the drive and determination to achieve my aspirations.</p>
